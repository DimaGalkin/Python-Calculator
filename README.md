# Python-Calculator

## About
This is a little calculator which i wrote in about an hour. When you press a button it adds appends what it says on the button to a string
then when you press '=' the program runs `eval(calculation)`; this is a much quicker way to calculate than 5 if statments checking the operator.
The CLR button clears the calculation string and sets the screen to a `:)`

## How To Use
It's very simple: all you have to do is install python then download the code from the githup page and finaly open the file.
